# Individual Programming Project - Prolog

This project was created as part of the University of Warsaw's Individual Programming Project course.

The goal of the project was to verify the thread-safety of given programs, that is to check if a scenario where two threads are in a critical section at the same time is possible. The exact description of the problem (in Polish) can be found in the [task.pdf](task.pdf) file.
